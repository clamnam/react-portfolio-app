The backend, powered by PHP, seamlessly interacts with a MySQL database managed through phpMyAdmin. The incorporation of regular expressions (regex) ensures data validation and enhances the integrity of the art piece information.\n\nOn the frontend, JavaScript is employed to enhance user interactions and provide dynamic features. The combination of Laravel's routing system and the Apache server ensures smooth navigation and optimal performance. The application allows users to create, view, update, and delete art pieces, providing a user-friendly interface for managing art-related data.\n\nThe project demonstrates a cohesive integration of backend and frontend technologies, offering a robust solution for art piece management within the context of a Laravel framework.",
